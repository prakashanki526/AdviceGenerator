Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier.","It is during our darkest moments that we must focus to see the light.","Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.","Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap but by the seeds that you plant.","Be the change that you wish to see in the world.","If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything.","A friend is someone who knows all about you and still loves you."];
